EcoLedjr is focused on creating a blockchain that surpasses Visa/Mastercard by the amount of Transaction per Second by being efficient + earth-friendly.

Built to be quantum-resistant in mind.

Current status: doing research in lattice-based cryptography to generate effective assymetrical key pairs.
Maybe replacing the hash of each transaction by something lattice as well.

Dart is used as an experiment to test its performance on high-performance mathematical operations.
